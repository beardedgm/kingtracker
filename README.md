# Kingdom Tracker

Kingdom Tracker helps manage your Pathfinder 2E kingdom by tracking resources, structures, and turn activities. Its goal is to provide a quick reference for your kingdom between sessions.

This is a purely client-side application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To run it, clone the repository and open `index.html` in a web browserâ€”no server setup is required.

The app should work in all modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Your data is stored locally using `localStorage`, so clearing browser data will delete your kingdoms.
